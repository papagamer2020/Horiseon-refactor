# refactorurban

In this assignment I changed around some coding so there wasn't any div soup (a whole lot of div codes) 
and condensed some of the css coding as well as the html coding for better optimizaiton 
I also made it to where when a non reader hovers over an image it should say a breif description of what is happening in the photo using alt
